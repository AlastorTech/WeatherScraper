# WeatherScraper

Who hasn't made one, right? I think it's one of those projects everyone looks at as a great way to learn API.

This project currently only has a very simply weather checker, it simply prints current weather data.

Plans:
This will be part of my lab server, and will keep me updated on the current weather through the use of a robotic clock.
